- ‚úÖ **Day 24: Serving Static Files & Documentation**
    
    ### üéØ Objective:
    
    Prepare your backend to serve frontend files (if needed) and write good API documentation.
    
    ### üìö Topics:
    
    - Serving static frontend from `public` folder
        
        Once you have a frontend application (e.g., built with React, Next.js, Vue, Angular), you'll need your Express backend to serve its compiled static assets.
        
        - **Serving from a `public` folder:** For simple static sites (plain HTML, CSS, JS) or if your frontend build process places everything into a `public` directory within your backend project.
            
            ```jsx
            // In app.js
            app.use(express.static('public')); // Serves files from the 'public' folder
            ```
            
    - Serving frontend build (from React/Next.js) with Express
        - **Serving a frontend build (from React/Next.js/Vue):**
        After running `npm run build` (or similar) in your frontend project, it generates an optimized build output (e.g., a `build/` folder for Create React App, or `.next/static` for Next.js). You can then point Express to serve this.JavaScript
            
            **Key Considerations:**
            
            - **Path:** The path to your frontend build folder (e.g., `../frontend/build` if your frontend is a sibling directory to your backend).
            - **Client-side Routing Fallback:** For Single Page Applications (SPAs) like React, if a user directly accesses a route like `/dashboard` (which doesn't exist as a physical file on the server), Express needs to serve the main `index.html` file, and the frontend router will then handle the path. This is crucial.
            
            ```jsx
            // In app.js
            import path from 'path';
            import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
            
            const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
            const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);
            
            // Serve static files from the frontend build directory
            // Assuming your frontend build output is in '../frontend/build' relative to your backend root
            app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../frontend/build')));
            
            // For any route not handled by your API, serve the frontend's index.html
            // This is crucial for client-side routing in SPAs (React Router, Vue Router, etc.)
            app.get('*', (req, res) => {
                res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, '../frontend', 'build', 'index.html'));
            });
            ```
            
            **Important:** This `app.get('*')` should be placed **after all your API routes** so that API calls are handled first.
            
    - Writing good API documentation (README or Swagger basic)
        
        Good API documentation is essential for:
        
        - **Usability:** Developers (including your future self) can quickly understand how to interact with your API.
        - **Maintainability:** Easier to update and extend the API.
        - **Consistency:** Encourages consistent API design.
        - **README.md:** For smaller projects or initial documentation, a detailed `README.md` in Markdown format is excellent. It's human-readable, version-controllable, and universally supported.
        - **Swagger/OpenAPI:** For larger, more complex APIs, OpenAPI (formerly Swagger Specification) is the industry standard. It's a machine-readable specification for REST APIs. Tools like Swagger UI can then generate interactive documentation directly from your OpenAPI specification. While powerful, setting up OpenAPI can be more involved.
    
    ### üîÅ Assignment:
    
    - Document your secure Task Manager API with route descriptions
        
        # Secure Task Manager API
        
        This API provides a robust and secure backend for a Task Manager application, allowing users to manage their tasks, authenticate securely, and handle user profiles.

            mkdir logs
            mkdir uploads
            
            ```
            
        
        ### Environment Variables
        
        Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables:
        
        ```
        NODE_ENV=development # or production
        PORT=5000
        MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/taskmanagerdb # Replace with your MongoDB connection string
        JWT_SECRET=supersecretjwtkey # Change this to a strong, random string
        JWT_EXPIRES_IN=90d
        JWT_COOKIE_EXPIRES_IN=90
        FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Your frontend URL for CORS
        EMAIL_USERNAME=your_email@example.com # For password reset emails (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun)
        EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
        EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
        EMAIL_PORT=587 # or 465 for SSL
        ```
        
        ### Running the Application
        
        ```jsx
        # For development (with nodemon, if installed)
        npm run dev
        
        # For production
        npm start
        ```
        
        The API will run on the port specified in your `.env` file (default: 3000).
        
        ## API Endpoints
        
        All API endpoints are prefixed with `/api`.

        ---
        
        ## Authentication
        
        This API uses **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for authentication.
        
        1. **Registration/Login:** Upon successful registration or login, the API sends a JWT token back to the client, typically as an HTTP-only cookie.
        2. **Protection:** Routes marked "Requires Auth Token" expect a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header as a `Bearer` token (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>`).
        3. **Cookie:** If `JWT_COOKIE_EXPIRES_IN` is set in `.env`, the token is also sent as an HTTP-only cookie, making it secure against XSS attacks.
        
        ## Error Handling
        
        The API uses a centralized error handling mechanism to provide consistent and informative error responses.
        
        - **Operational Errors (4xx):** Expected errors (e.g., invalid input, resource not found, unauthorized access). These return a `4xx` status code and a clear `message` to the client.JSON
            
            ```jsx
            {
                "success": false,
                "status": "fail",
                "message": "Invalid input data: Title is required."
            }
            ```
            
        - **Programming/Internal Errors (5xx):** Unexpected errors (e.g., database connection issues, server code bugs). In `development` mode, the full error details (including stack trace) are returned for debugging. In `production` mode, a generic "Something went wrong!" message is returned to the client to avoid leaking sensitive information.JSON
            
            ```jsx
            {
                "success": false,
                "status": "error",
                "message": "Something went wrong! Please try again later."
            }
            ```
            
        
        ## Security Measures
        
        The API is equipped with several security middlewares:
        
        - **CORS:** Configured to allow requests from specified origins (`FRONTEND_URL`).
        - **Helmet:** Sets various HTTP headers (`X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, etc.) to mitigate common web vulnerabilities.
        - **Express-Rate-Limit:** Limits the number of requests per IP address to prevent brute-force attacks and abuse (e.g., 100 requests per 15 minutes for all `/api/` routes).
        - **Express-Mongo-Sanitize:** Cleans `req.body`, `req.query`, and `req.params` from `$` and `.` characters to prevent NoSQL query injection.
        - **XSS-Clean:** Sanitizes user input to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
        
        ## Logging and Monitoring
        
        - **Morgan:** Used for HTTP request logging. In development, it logs to the console (`dev` format). In production, it can be configured to log to a file.
        - **Winston:** A robust, production-ready logging library.
            - Logs application events and errors with different severity levels (`debug`, `info`, `error`).
            - Logs errors to `logs/error.log` and all combined logs to `logs/combined.log` in JSON format.
            - Automatically includes timestamps and stack traces for errors.
            - Captures uncaught exceptions and unhandled promise rejections for critical error monitoring.
